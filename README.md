# Record Collection Manager

## Track Your Vinyl Record Activity!

For this term of CPSC 210 I will be designing a program that will
not only keep track of the records in your collection, but also your **use**.
Using this application, you will be able to:
- Generate a collection of the records that you own
- Record data about each record **including** personal data (rating, listens)

This will be a very beneficial application for users wishing to gather insights into their
listening history as well as eliminating the need for "crate digging" to find out if you own
a particular album.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add an album to my collection
- As a user, I want to be able to search my collection for a particular record and view its information
- As a user, I want to be able to view my albums given a particular rating
- As a user, I want to be able to view my most listened to album
- As a user, I want to be able to save my collection to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my collection from file
