# Record Collection Manager

## Track Your Vinyl Record Activity!

I have designed a program that will
not only keep track of the records in your collection, but also your **use**.
Using this application, you will be able to:
- Generate a collection of the records that you own
- Record data about each record **including** personal data (rating, listens)
- Search through this collection

This will be a very beneficial application for users wishing to gather insights into their
listening history as well as eliminating the need for "crate digging" to find out if you own
a particular album.

**NOTE:** There are 2 versions of this application. The current version
utilizes a GUI but has limited functions. In the terminal version (commented out) there are adittional features
available such as viewing specific album information, sorting albums based on rating, and viewing your most listened to
album.
