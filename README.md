# Record Collection Manager

## Track Your Vinyl Record Activity!

For this term of CPSC 210 I will be designing a program that will
not only keep track of the records in your collection, but also your **use**.
Using this application, you will be able to:
- Generate a collection of the records that you own
- Record data about each record **including** personal data (rating, listens)

This will be a very beneficial application for users wishing to gather insights into their
listening history as well as eliminating the need for "crate digging" to find out if you own
a particular album.
